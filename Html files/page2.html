				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p>The early detection of variation in heart rate is essential for effective treatment because
					cardiovascular disease is one of the leading cause for death worldwide. In the field of medical
					diagnostics, heartbeat detection is a crucial task, but conventional methods call for specialized
					tools and qualified personnel. The use of signal processing and computer vision techniques has
					gained popularity in recent years. This study describes a technique for real-time heart rate
					monitoring using a webcam and JavaScript. The suggested method takes the facial region out of the
					webcam's video frames and uses signal processing to estimate the heart rate. In particular, the
					technique detects the subtle color changes brought on by the blood flow in the skin and uses the
					chrominance information of the facial region to estimate the heart rate. The method also employs
					motion compensation algorithms to decrease the impact of head motions and facial expressions on
					heart rate measurement. The suggested approach can offer a low-cost and non-invasive way to detect a
					person's heart rate and has potential applications in healthcare, fitness monitoring, and wellness
					tracking.</p>

					<h1>Working Methodology</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="topcards">
					<p class="one"><span>1, </span>This technique's fundamental premise is that blood flowing down the
						face alters the skin's hue in a way that is apparent to the camera but invisible to the human
						eye.
						There isn't much information in the sections for the eyes, lips, and nose. So, to obtain regions
						with skin probability, we apply a skin mask.
						Record Video with Webcam: A subject (human) sits in front of a webcam and records footage.</p>
					<p class="two"><span>2, </span>Face Identification: The Affine transform algorithm is employed. High
						identification efficiency, few false positives, and practicality are some of this algorithm's
						characteristics.The Haar function is used to rule out some traits that are common to all humans
						Integral pictures analyze rectangular characteristics in a consistent amount of time. OpenCv is
						used to train the classifier and the faceial recognization algorithem to get the best features.
					</p>
					<p class="three"><span>3, </span>RGB to LAB Conversion: Here, RGB photos of the same items taken
						with various camera types and ambient illumination appear differently. The LAB colour space is
						independent of unit. Here, the L denotes the image's brightness, the A and B colour channels
						denote additional colour combinations, and the A represents the red or green component colour. A
						negative A is represented by green, and a positive A is represented by red. Yellow or blue are
						represented on the Baxis. Yellow denotes positive values of B and blue indicates negative values
						of B. The numbers L=0, A=0, B=0, depict absolute black and L=100 depict white. In the RGB colour
						space, light is a significant factor, although in outdoor settings, it is not as significant.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="botcards">
					<p class="one"><span>4, </span>Skin Identification: All unnecessary regions that do not give useful
						information, such as nostrils, eyebrows, lips, chin,checks, eyes, are detected and removed using
						a skin classifier.These other features are not so useful in our case, moreover adding this and
						calculating with all the feautres of the face might create unnecessary noise and cause sudden
						highs and lows in the signle which alter the output drastically.
						This creats a sudden spike in the output jumping well over the limit,this may also effect
						accuracy. So, for those reasons we elimated some face features like the nose, lips, chin etc</p>
					<p class="two"><span>5, </span>Signal Amplification: The three signals used in the LAB colour space
						are ‘L’, ‘A’, and ‘B’, where ‘L stands for the brightness of the image and ‘A’ and ‘B together
						stand for its fusion of the other two channels. L lacks color information, thus you must
						separate A and B channels of color to from it. Blood pulses cause minute changes in brightness
						and intensity that are recorded in the LAB colour space. Independent Component Analysis or
						Principal Component Analysis reduces dimensionality when utilised.</p>
					<p class="three"><span>6, </span>HR Recognition: HR can be calculated from the recovered signal
						using time or frequency-domain analysis. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be used to convert
						signals into the frequency domain. A signal that has been sampled over a predetermined amount of
						time is used to determine the signal's peak detection method. The person's detected HR is
						reported as this peak value. Peak-finding algorithm following the Fast Fourier Transform's
						conversion of the signal to the frequency domain. We must first count the frequency range's
						peaks and keep track of how long it takes for the first 30 frames of the image before we can
						calculate the heart rate in real-time.</p>

					<h1>Algorithem details</h1>

				<div class="algod">
					<p class="One"><span>The Affine transform algorithm </span><br><br>
						Affine transformations are a class of mathematical operations that encompass rotation, scaling, translation, shearing, and several similar transformations that are regularly used for various applications in mathematics and computer graphics. To start, we will draw a distinct (yet thin) line between affine and linear transformations before discussing the augmented matrix formalism typically used in practice.
						The affine transformation technique is typically used to correct for geometric distortions or deformations that occur with non-ideal camera angles. For example, satellite imagery uses affine transformations to correct for wide angle lens distortion, panorama stitching, and image registration. Transforming and fusing the images to a large, flat coordinate system is desirable to eliminate distortion. This enables easier interactions and calculations</p>

					<p class="two"><span>The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) </span><br><br>
						A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that calculates the
						discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of some sequence – the discrete Fourier transform
						is a tool to convert specific types of sequences of functions into other types
						of representations. Another way to explain discrete Fourier transform is that it
						transforms the structure of the cycle of a waveform into sine components.
						A fast Fourier transform can be used in various types of signal processing. It may be useful in reading things like sound waves, or for any image-processing technologies. A fast Fourier transform can be used to solve various types of equations, or show various types of frequency activity in useful ways.</p>

					<p class="three"><span>OpenCV Algorithm</span> <br><br>
						OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image
						processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in
						today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or
						even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is
						capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its
						various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features. The
						first OpenCV version was 1.0. OpenCV is released under a BSD license and hence it’s free for
						both academic and commercial use. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports
						Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android.
